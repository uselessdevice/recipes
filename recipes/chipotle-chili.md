Adapted from [Chili Pepper Madness](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/recipes/chipotle-chili/)

- 1 jalapeno pepper, chopped
- 1 poblano pepper, chopped
- 1 serrano chili pepper, chopped (or similar spicy chili pepper)
- 4 cloves garlic chopped
- 3 cans fire roasted tomatoes (42 oz, or use equivalent fresh or diced tomatoes)
- 2 cans red kidney beans (or black beans, pinto beans, or a combination of beans)

## Steps

2. Add meat, onion, and peppers.
3. Cook about 10 minutes until meat is cooked through and vegetables are softened.
4. Add garlic and cook another minute.
5. Add tomatoes and stir.
    - If using fresh tomatoes, cook about 10 minutes until they break down.
    - If using canned tomatoes, continue to next step.
6. Add remaining ingredients (beans, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chili powder, cumin, chili flakes, salt and pepper) and stir well to combine.
7. Reduce to low heat and cook for at least one hour, stirring occasionally.
8. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.

## Notes

12 oz by volume of TVP rehydrates to 1.5 lb ground meat equivalent

Benefits from using a homemade adobo sauce with cinnamon in it (can substitute this for the chili powder).
