- 1 T thinly sliced green onion
- 1/2 T butter, softened
- 1/8 t salt
- 1/8 t cayenne pepper

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350° F and coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Cut the squash in half, scoop out seeds and loose stringy flesh. 
3. Place squash face-down on baking sheet and bake 50-55 minutes until tender.
4. While squash is baking, combine spinach, 3 T Parmesan, green onion, butter, salt, and cayenne pepper.
5. When squash is tender, scoop the flesh into the bowl with the spinach mixture, leaving a 1/4 inch shell.
6. Mix filling well, then spoon into shells and top with remaining Parmesan.
7. Bake at 350° F for 25-30 more minutes until heated through and top is golden brown.
