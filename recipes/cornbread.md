# Cast iron skillet jalapeño cornbread

Combines a recipe from [Love & Lemons](https://www.loveandlemons.com/jalapeno-cornbread/) with the recipe from the Bob's Red Mill GF medium grind cornmeal pouch.

If not using a preheated cast iron pan, use an 8-inch square pan and adjust the oven temperature to 375° F.

All of the dry ingredients for this recipe fit in a 24-oz container, so you can store them premixed and add them to the liquid mixture.
