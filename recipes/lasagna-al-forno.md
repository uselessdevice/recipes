# Lasagna al forno

Tastes like you put significantly more effort into it than you did.

Combines a recipe from [Inside the Rustic Kitchen](https://www.insidetherustickitchen.com/classic-beef-lasagne-spinach-pasta/) with the recipe from the Jovial gluten free lasagna box and a jar of Rao's arrabiata.

Jovial's GF lasagna can be baked without preboiling, follow the cooking instructions on the box if using a different brand.
The sauce used can be substituted as needed.

The recipe as presented here is halved from the source material for a more reasonable amount of food and leftovers for two people.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 2-1/2 T butter (35g)
- 2-1/2 T GF flour (35g)
- 2 c milk
- 1/2 t nutmeg, ideally freshly grated
- 1/2 c parmesan, freshly grated (35g)
- 1/2 t kosher salt
- black pepper to taste, freshly ground
- 1 28-oz jar Rao's arrabiata (24-oz jar might work, 32-oz jar is too much)
- 1/2 13-oz box Jovial gluten free lasagna
- 1-1/2 c Villasenor Chihuahua cheese (or shredded mozzarella)

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 375° F and locate a baking dish with a volume of 1.8 L (about 2" depth for an 8" square or 9" round).
1. Cook ground beef through and set aside on paper towels to drain.
1. Make a bechamel sauce:
    1. In a saucepan, heat butter until it starts to bubble.
    1. Whisk in flour and let cook for one minute.
    1. Whisking constantly, add the milk in a thin stream until it forms a smooth sauce.
    1. Stir in nutmeg, parmesan, salt, and pepper.
    1. Stir sauce and cook over medium heat or lower until running the whisk through the sauce leaves tracks and immediately remove from heat.
1. In a mixing bowl, stir the cooked beef and jar of sauce together.
1. Assemble the lasagna:
    1. Cover the bottom of your pan with 1/2 cup of the tomato beef sauce.
    1. Add four uncooked lasagna noodles; you might need to break them up depending on the shape of your pan.
    1. Spread 1/3 of the bechamel on top of the noodles.
    1. Cover with 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce and top with 3/8 cup cheese.
    1. Add two more rounds of the noodle-bechamel-tomato-cheese layers (for three noodle layers total). If the last layer of cheese is close to the top of the pan, leave it off until it's time to remove foil from the dish.
1. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake at 375°F for 50 minutes.
1. Uncover and pat down the noodles gently to flatten the top. If the last layer of cheese was left off, add that now. Bake uncovered for 10 minutes until brown.
